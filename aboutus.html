							        <h3>About Me</h3>
									<p>The photography is an art , camera ought to be utilized for a chronicle of life , for rendering the very substance and pith of the thing itself. The more you take pictures , the more you understand what can and can't be captured. You simply need to continue doing it.
                                    For me Photography is about people being veritable and after that allowing myself to depict that moment to remember it until the finish of time . So, i started clicking pictures  two years ago. I never intended to be an expert photographer ,so i turn my passion for photography into a profitable profession. Therefore , this website can also distributes my content through Getty images, moreover clients can also explore beautiful photos through this website. I can say that i got inspired by  Peter Mckinnon and Sam kolder both of them are professionals</p>
